# Hangman Game

The Hangman Game application provides users with the opportunity to engage in a classic game of chance against the computer. The gameplay commences with the user inputting their name. Subsequently, the game displays successive stages of the hangman from its initial stage while also selecting a random word, concealed at the onset of the game. Throughout the game, the player's objective is to guess the letters forming the chosen word correctly, with six lives corresponding to the hangman's body parts - head, body, right arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg. The outcome of each round is determined by the player's success in guessing the correct letters of the word.

Throughout the game, the user may encounter three potential scenarios when making a letter choice: the letter is present in the word, the letter is not part of the word, or the letter has been previously guessed by the player. Additionally, any input other than a single letter will be considered invalid, and it will not result in the deduction of a life.

Once the game is over the user is presented with the option to initiate another round or exit the application.


## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
